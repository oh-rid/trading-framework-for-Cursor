## 1. Core Principles (3–5 bullets, ≤ 15 words each)
- Don't fight liquidity: macro-oriented strategy focused on money flows
- Contrarian stance: highest returns when betting against consensus, executed with caution
- Half a bull market: crypto 2020-2021 halted early by Fed tightening
- OBBA ("One Big Beautiful Act"): potential crypto-law catalyst
- "Smart people admit mistakes, fools double down": public invalidation to mitigate bias

## 2. Key Metrics (table)
| Metric | Layer | Freq | Source | Bullish if | Bearish if |
|--------|-------|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Funding Rate | Derivatives | 8 h | Exchange | Negative | > 0.10 % |
| Skew 25Δ | Options | Daily | Exchange | Call IV > Put IV | Put IV > Call IV |
| Global M2 | Macro | Monthly | FRED | Rising | Falling |
| BTC IV | Volatility | Daily | Deribit | < 50 % | > 80 % |
| VaR Portfolio | Risk | Daily | Internal | < 5 % | > 8 % |

## 3. Risk Approach (≤ 60 words)
Strict VaR control with a daily 3-5 % limit. Cluster sizing for thematic asset groups. Delta-hedging of option positions. Flexible stop-losses: quick exit instead of "doubling down". Considers volatility–liquidity linkage.

## 4. Bias Profile
- Confirmation bias: uses contrarian sanity check against crowding
- Loss aversion: avoids doubling positions, prefers quick exits
- Overconfidence: public invalidation to curb excessive certainty
- Recency bias: focuses on macro cycles and long-term liquidity trends
