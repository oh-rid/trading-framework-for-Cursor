# Knowledge Bank

> ⚠️ **Warning – Sample Content Only**
> 
> Each sub-folder contains *example* distillates to illustrate the format. They are **not exhaustive**. An essential part of the learning workflow is to curate and distil your **own** knowledge: books you read, analysts you trust, metrics you track. Replace or extend the samples with material that suits your process.


This folder stores **knowledge distillates** produced by prompts and data-collection tools.

## Layout

| Folder | Contents | Typical use-case |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| `mindset/`   | Frameworks (mindsets) of individual analysts, plus meta-level combined frameworks | Plug a bias-firewall or risk-kernel into your strategy |
| `persons/`   | Concise notes on a single author / economist | 
| `summaries/` | Short summaries of books, papers, reports | 

## How to work with distillates

1. **Start narrow.**  Use *individual* mindsets or book summaries first — transparency matters; you will see which piece of logic actually drives results.
2. **Iterate.**  Mix and match multiple distillates to test hypotheses quickly in notebooks, dashboards, or chat sessions.
3. **Go meta if needed.**  When you have lots of material across styles (macro, options, portfolio management), build a combined meta-mindset.  These give a holistic view but hide each source’s contribution.

> TL;DR: begin with focused distillates, then expand.  That keeps the logic auditable and the experiments fast.
