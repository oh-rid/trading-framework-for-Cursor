# Sixth Street Investment Philosophy

> Distillation of approaches and rules based on public analysis of the firm.

## 1. Core Principles

1. **Counter-cyclicality:** Trim risk in euphoria, preserve capital for crises.
2. **Flexibility:** Migrate to where the returns are. Market/sector/asset are just tools.
3. **Mortality of ideas:** A theme lives 1-3 years. Always generate new ones.
4. **Private markets:** Seek inefficiencies (93 % of large companies are off-exchange).
5. **Problem solving:** Offer a creative solution (growth/debt), not just money.
6. **Value creation:** The goal is growth through partnership, not speculation.

## 2. Mental Models

* **“Entrepreneurial firm”:** Think like a business founder, not an asset manager.
* **“Whiteboard meeting”:** Approach a partner with a blank slate to co-create a solution.
* **“Meet the tiger”:** In a crisis, stop blame-seeking and attack the problem as a team.
* **“Outgrow yourself”:** Team success over personal ego to enable free information flow.

## 3. Applicability Constraints

* **Scale:** Requires deploying hundreds of millions to billions per deal.
* **Complexity:** Deals demand deep legal and sector expertise.
* **Access:** Model relies on exclusive access to private transactions.
* **Capital flexibility:** Requires non-standard funds with flexible mandates and horizons.
