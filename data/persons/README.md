# Mindsets of Notable Traders and Economists

Use this folder to store concise mindset documents (Markdown summaries, key principles, mental models) of prominent traders, investors, and economists.

Recommended workflow:

1. Prompt ChatGPT in *agentic* mode to research the person and generate a structured "mindset" summary.
2. Save the resulting Markdown file here, naming it `<person>_mindset.md`.
3. Keep files lightweight—avoid uploading large PDFs or copyrighted material. Instead, focus on distilled insights and references.

These documents help build a knowledge base of proven investment approaches and decision-making frameworks.

## Example mindset files

- `stanley_druckenmiller_mindset.md` – Macro hedge-fund legend known for risk-adjusted returns.
- `lyn_alden_mindset.md` – Independent macro strategist focusing on global capital cycles.
