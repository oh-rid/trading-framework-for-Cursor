# Deep Research Outputs

This folder stores the reports and artefacts generated by the deep-research utilities located in `tools/research/` (e.g., `researchctl.py`, `deep_research.py`).

Typical contents include:

- Markdown reports with in-depth macro or thematic analysis
- Supporting data snapshots (CSV, JSON)
- Charts or small illustrative images

Avoid committing large raw datasets or confidential materials. Keep only concise, non-sensitive outputs that are useful for documentation and collaboration.
