# Deep Dive: Current Macroeconomic Backdrop and Position in the Economic Cycle

> Date: 3 August 2025

## 1. Key Macro Indicators (G-7)

| Metric | Current Level | 3-Year Trend | Comment |
|--------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| Real GDP (QoQ, SAAR) | US 1.3 %, EU 0.6 %, JP 0.4 % | Gradual slowdown after the 2023 peak | Drivers – fading fiscal impulse, tighter credit |
| CPI (YoY) | US 2.4 %, EU 2.1 %, JP 1.8 % | Down from 8 %+ 2022 highs | Energy shock reversed, services still "sticky" |
| Unemployment Rate | US 4.1 %, EU 6.3 %, JP 2.7 % | Rising from record lows | Hiring slowdown in IT and construction |
| PMI Composite | 49.8 (mild contraction) | <50 for five straight months | Manufacturing in recession, services cooling |
| UST Curve 3 m-10 y | −56 bps (inverted) | 18-month inversion | Longest inversion since the 1980s |
| HY-IG Spread | 420 bps | +110 bps since Jan-24 | Rising defaults in CRE and consumer credit |

## 2. Monetary Policy

• **Fed**: Fed funds 5.00 – 5.25 %; first dovish cut (−25 bps) expected in Sep-25 if services inflation eases to 2 %.

• **ECB**: Deposit rate 3.75 %; two 25 bp cuts already delivered in 2025 but further action on hold given wage growth.

• **BoJ**: Ended YCC, lifted short-term rate to 0.25 %. Gradually shrinking JGB balance sheet.

**Implication**: Global liquidity is improving, yet rates remain restrictive → pressure on multiples and cyclical demand.

## 3. Cycle Stage (Conference Board + LEI)

| Metric | Level | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| LEI (US, YoY) | −4.2 % | Typical of late-cycle / pre-recession phase |
| Coincident Index | +0.8 % | Current activity still expanding |
| OECD CLI | 99.2 (<100) | Decelerating, near trough |

**Verdict**: The economy sits in a **late-expansion / early-slowdown** phase; a global recession is not confirmed—more likely a soft landing with low growth.

## 4. Beneficiary Sectors & Risk Assets

| Asset | Positioning | Rationale |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| High-quality IG bonds | Overweight | Yields have peaked; Fed easing expected |
| Gold / defensive real assets | Overweight | Real rate ~2 %, geopolitical risk |
| Cyclical equities (semis, luxury) | Underweight | PMI decline, margin pressure |
| REITs (data centers, industrial) | Market-weight | Targeted resilient demand, but high cost of capital |
| High-yield & leveraged loans | Underweight | Defaults (>3 %) and spreads rising |

## 5. Scenario Distribution (12 m)

| Scenario | Probability | Brief Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Soft landing | 55 % | Inflation → 2 %, Fed −100 bps, GDP ≈ 1 % |
| Technical recession | 30 % | Two quarters GDP <0 with limited job losses |
| Re-acceleration | 10 % | AI capex & fiscal support sustain demand |
| Hard recession | 5 % | US CRE shock + European debt stress |

## 6. "Black Swan" Risks

1. **Financial instability**: default chain in US commercial real estate.
2. **Geopolitics**: escalation in Taiwan Strait, oil shock > $150.
3. **Political cycle**: US elections (Nov-26) → tax policy uncertainty.

## 7. Bottom Line

The economy is moving into the late-cycle phase: growth decelerates, inflation falls, the curve remains inverted. Base case – soft landing with limited rate cuts and moderate market volatility. Investors are advised to upgrade portfolio quality, reduce cyclical risk, and use defensive assets as hedges.
