# Chrome Data Storage

This folder stores output generated by the Chrome automation utilities located in `tools/chrome/`.

Place here any profiles, exported data, or temporary files that result from running the Chrome integration scripts. Do **not** commit sensitive information or large binary blobs to the public repository; keep only lightweight, non-sensitive artefacts needed for development or testing.
