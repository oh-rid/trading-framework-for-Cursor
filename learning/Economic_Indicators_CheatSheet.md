*(A condensed distillation of Charles Steindel’s "Economic Indicators for Professionals" combined with our internal frameworks)*

## 1. Ten-Second Takeaways

1. Numbers by themselves are noise. They matter only when connected to other data and to your own context.  
2. Focus on the **rate of change** and **revisions**, not the raw level.  
3. Build a mosaic from **leading**, **coincident**, and **lagging** indicators.  
4. Classic sequence: income → spending → output → employment.  
5. Inventories and building permits often flag the cycle’s turning points first.  
6. Core PCE is the Fed’s main thermometer; PPI leads consumer prices.  
7. A gap between wage growth and productivity = squeeze on corporate margins.  
8. Fiscal impulse can support or choke the market.  
9. Tax receipts reveal the state of the economy faster than official releases.  
10. After every data release, **update** your recession probability—never cling to stale estimates.

## 2. Three Classes of Indicators

| Group | Examples | How It Helps |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Leading** | Building permits, ISM new orders, weekly jobless claims | Early signal of future expansion or contraction; enter/exit positions in time. |
| **Coincident** | Non-farm payrolls, PCE spending, factory output | Shows what is happening **now**. Confirms that a trend is real. |
| **Lagging** | Unemployment rate, headline CPI | Confirms the story after the fact; useful for risk control. |

## 3. Simple “Rule-of-Thumb” Guides

- Building permits +1 pp YoY → GDP adds ~0.3 pp two to three quarters later.  
- +100k jobless claims above the 4-week low → recession probability +15 % within six months.  
- Core PCE 0.5 pp above the Fed’s target for three consecutive months → high risk of a 7–10 % equity correction.  
- Inventory-to-sales ratio > 1.4 → production will soon slow, commodity prices under pressure.  
- House prices −10 % YoY → household spending falls 0.5–1 pp about a year later.

## 4. Pre-Trade Checklist

1. Scan leading signals (construction, new orders, claims).  
2. Compare the dynamics of income, spending, and inventories.  
3. Check whether fiscal policy and the Fed are supportive.  
4. Cross-check Core PCE against the 2 % target.  
5. Validate conclusions with alternative data (satellite, blockchain, surveys).  
6. Run a bias-check using our *Investment Thinking Framework*.  
7. If signals are sufficient, size the position while accounting for hidden risk.

## 5. Counter-Cyclical Advice (Sixth Street-style)

- **Cut risk when everyone is euphoric; buy when fear dominates.**  
- **Rotate capital** across sectors as different parts of the economy accelerate or slow.  
- **Every idea lives 1–3 years.** Track new data and be ready to pivot.  
- **Look for inefficiencies off public markets.** Private deals are often mis-priced by headline stats.

## 6. Final Thought

> Data are bricks. Value emerges when you assemble them into the architecture of your strategy and act against the crowd, guided by facts—not emotions.
